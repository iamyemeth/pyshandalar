# PyShandalar

In 1997 Microprose released a computer game called Magic: the Gathering, based on the Wizards of the Coast card game of the same name. This game, simply called Shandalar by it's fan, continues to have a thriving community of players some 25 years later.

The reason for the game's cult status, in my opinion, is simply because the AI is SO GOOD. Microprose managed to develop a game AI that feels like playing against a smart opponent. Most surprising to me is that this game seems to represent the peak of single player card game AI, being much better than subsequent Magic: the Gathering games and single player modes of other card games Hearthstone.

This project is my attempt to explore different approaches to creating an AI for a card game as sufficiently rich as Magic: the Gathering with the ultimate aim of produces results as good and fun as Shandalar itself.

Please note that this is not a clone of Shandalar, or in fact of Magic: the Gathering, I will be drawing heavily on the single player Shandalar game and Mtg ruleset as a test bed for the AI. For this reason you can expect the bare minimum in graphical fidelity so be warned.
